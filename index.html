                    Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (born 5 February 1985), better known as Cristiano Ronaldo, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward. 
                    He is the captain of the Portuguese national team and he is currently playing at Saudi Arabian football club Al Nassr. He is considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time, and, by some, as the greatest ever.

                    Ronaldo began his professional career with Sporting CP at age 17 in 2002, and signed for Manchester United a year later. He won three back-to-back Premier League titles: in 2006-07, 2007-08, and 2008-09.
                     In 2007-08, Ronaldo, helped United win the UEFA Champions League. In 2008-09, he won his first FIFA Club World Cup in December 2008, and he also won his first Ballon d'Or. At one point Ronaldo was the most expensive professional footballer of all time, after moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid for approximately £80 m in July 2009.

                    He won his first trophy with Real Madrid in 2011, the 2010-11 Copa del Rey. In the next season, he won his first La Liga title with the club, the 2011-12 La Liga.
